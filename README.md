# Online-Offline-Budget-App

 A Budget tracker in which a user can quickly add expenses/deposits online or offline! When offline, a user can enter transactions/deposits, and the total populates with all entries when online, giving users an easy way to track their money.

This project uses node, mongoose, path, express, IndexedDB, cache API, and Service Workers to provide an reliable offline experience.
